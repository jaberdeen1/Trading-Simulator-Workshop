    "Large investing and trading firms keep rich stock exchange data at their analysts and traders fingertips. If youre just a Uni student wanting to test some trading strategies in your spare time, that kind of data is a little out of reach, making it harder to test any trading or pricing theories you may have. \n",

    "## Getting Data into Python\n",
    "There are a number of ways to get stock exchange data into python:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   API's - An Application Programming Interface is a broad term for an interface between a program and a server or data source. For our purposes, an API provides a link from your code to some source of stock market data. API's (and the data they link to) are reliable, high-frequency and very rich, but often costly.\n",
    "*   Downloading CSV's from yahoo finance and importing them into python manually - exceptionally slow and repetitive, but completely free and easy for most people to do.\n",
    "*   Data Scraping - Many websites freely publish stock market data, data scraping is a way to request this data and download it directly into python automatically, in a format that python can easily work with. This takes a decent bit of coding knowledge (and time) to code up yourself.\n",
    "*   yfinance package - yfinance is a python package that scrapes data from yahoo finance for you, and imports it as pandas dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Notes on Data Scrapers\n",
    "*   It is important when using data scrapers (including yfinance) to consider its legality. Data scraping is in many cases and many countries perfectly legal (it's how Google's search engine works). However you should make sure to follow the terms of service of the website which you scrape from, and avoid copyright infringement. As rules of thumb: don't collect personally identifiable information, don't publish any scraped data without checking terms of service, don't scrape data too many times per minute, you can be blocked if you're slowing their servers down, and use the data for educational or personal non-commercial research purposes only.\n",
    "*   It is also important to note that free, scraped data is often viewed as not being as reliable or accurate as a premium paid service like some API's. This is partially why it is not reccomended to use this data for real trading."
